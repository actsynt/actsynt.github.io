<p style="text-align: justify"> Augusto B. Corrêa is a Ph.D. student at the University of Basel, Switzerland, under the supervision of Prof. Malte Helmert. He works in classical planning, focusing on how different representations impact the performance of planners. Other topics of his research include generalized planning, computational complexity, and interactive models for planning. Augusto is the creator of the Powerlifted planners and one of the developers of the Levitron and Scorpion Maidu planners, which won the satisficing track of the last International Planning Competition.

<h3 style="text-align: justify" id="keynote-abstract---download-slides">Lifted Planning: Recent Advances in Planning Using First-Order Representations</h3>

<p>This talk addresses the following problem:  given a finite set of observations of system behavior, each observation 
itself being a finite sequence of system states, and a query consisting of a Finite Linear-Time Temporal Logic (LTL) 
formula with missing sub-formulas, compute missing the missing sub-formulas that make the formula true for all observations.  
This so-called query-checking problem has many applications in the analysis of time-series data, including server logs and 
financial trend data, as well as generally in system comprehension and system-specification mining.  The presentation first 
introduces Finite LTL, which is the well-known LTL logic of Pnueli interpreted over finite, rather than infinite, state sequences.  
It will then show how automata may be constructed from such formulas that recognize exactly the sequences making the formula true, 
and how these automata may be adapted to Finite LTL queries in which sub-formulas are missing.  A procedure is then described that 
uses the automaton representation of such a query to solve for the missing sub-formulas for a given a set of finite state sequences.  
Preliminary experimental results of a prototype implementation are also given.
This work is joint with Sam Huang.

<p style="text-align: justify"> After PhD from Technical University of Munich in 2013 and from Masaryk University Brno in 2014, Jan was a research fellow at IST Austria and since 2015 a professor at TU Munich, getting tenure there. While still affiliated, he has recently moved to MU Brno. His main focus is basic research in verification, control and explainability of complex systems. Since 2013 he has been advocating and pioneering the use of AI and ML in verification, in particular in reactive synthesis.

<p>We discuss a learning-based framework for guessing a winning strategy in a parity game originating from a reactive synthesis problem for LTL. Its applications range from cases where the game's huge size prohibits rigorous approaches, over increasing scalability of rigorous synthesis, to explainability of synthesized controllers. We discuss the advantages and caveats of these new avenues in synthesis.
On the technical level, we describe (i) how to reflect the highly structured logical information in game's states, the so-called semantic labelling, coming from the recent LTL-to-automata translations, and (ii) to do so by learning from previously solved games, bringing the solution process closer to human-like reasoning.
