<p>This talk addresses the following problem:  given a finite set of observations of system behavior, each observation 
itself being a finite sequence of system states, and a query consisting of a Finite Linear-Time Temporal Logic (LTL) 
formula with missing sub-formulas, compute missing the missing sub-formulas that make the formula true for all observations.  
This so-called query-checking problem has many applications in the analysis of time-series data, including server logs and 
financial trend data, as well as generally in system comprehension and system-specification mining.  The presentation first 
introduces Finite LTL, which is the well-known LTL logic of Pnueli interpreted over finite, rather than infinite, state sequences.  
It will then show how automata may be constructed from such formulas that recognize exactly the sequences making the formula true, 
and how these automata may be adapted to Finite LTL queries in which sub-formulas are missing.  A procedure is then described that 
uses the automaton representation of such a query to solve for the missing sub-formulas for a given a set of finite state sequences.  
Preliminary experimental results of a prototype implementation are also given.
This work is joint with Sam Huang.
